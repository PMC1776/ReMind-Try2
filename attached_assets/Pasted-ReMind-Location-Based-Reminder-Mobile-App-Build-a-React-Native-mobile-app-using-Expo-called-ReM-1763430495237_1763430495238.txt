ReMind - Location-Based Reminder Mobile App
Build a React Native mobile app (using Expo) called ReMind - a privacy-first, location-based reminder application with end-to-end encryption.

Core Concept
Users create reminders that trigger automatically when they arrive at or leave specific locations. The app monitors their location in the background and sends push notifications when they enter/exit geofenced areas.

API Keys Required
Google Maps API Key:

Enable: Maps SDK for Android/iOS
Enable: Places API
Enable: Geocoding API
Add to app.json config:
{
  "expo": {
    "android": {
      "config": {
        "googleMaps": {
          "apiKey": "YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY"
        }
      }
    },
    "ios": {
      "config": {
        "googleMapsApiKey": "YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
Implementation:

Use react-native-maps library for map component
Use Google Places Autocomplete for location search
Use Google Geocoding API for address lookups
Backend Connection
Point all API calls to your existing Express/Node.js backend. The backend already handles:

PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM
JWT authentication
Session management
Email verification (Resend API)
Rate limiting
End-to-end encryption support (stores public keys, receives encrypted fields)

Important Implementation Notes
Location Permissions:

Request "Always Allow" for background location
Explain why it's needed: "To remind you when you arrive/leave locations"
Handle permission denial gracefully
Background Tasks:

Use Expo's TaskManager for background location updates
Register geofence monitoring task
Keep battery usage efficient
Encryption:

Encrypt before sending to server
Decrypt after receiving from server
Store private key in Expo SecureStore
Never send private key to server
State Management:

Use Zustand for: auth, encryption keys, location, settings
Use React Query for: server state, caching, optimistic updates
Error Handling:

Show user-friendly error messages
Handle network errors gracefully
Log errors for debugging (use console.error)
Performance:

Virtualize long lists (FlatList)
Memoize expensive calculations
Lazy load screens
Optimize map rendering (don't show all pins if zoomed out)
Accessibility:

Add accessible labels to all interactive elements
Support screen readers
Ensure sufficient color contrast
Make touch targets at least 44x44pt
Platform Differences:

Use Platform API to handle iOS/Android differences
Test notifications on both platforms
Handle back button on Android
Success Criteria
The app should:

✅ Allow users to create location-based reminders
✅ Show reminders on an interactive map
✅ Send push notifications when entering/leaving geofenced areas
✅ Support background location monitoring
✅ Encrypt sensitive data client-side
✅ Work offline and sync when online
✅ Have smooth, native-feeling animations
✅ Follow iOS and Android design guidelines
✅ Handle all edge cases gracefully
✅ Be production-ready with proper error handling
Build this app with clean, maintainable code following React Native best practices. Focus on user experience and performance.
